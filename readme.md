## Overview

Sometimes you simply donâ€™t need to use all the features of an entire CMS. 
Bombolone lets you have a good core, with five modules are essential 
for almost all web applications.

You can control them from the administration panel, and each has 
different tools to edit, create or delete.
It's important to note that beginning the application has two types 
of users: administrator and user classic. Administrator can do everything, 
but the User have only a limited set of tools to edit contents of other little things.

The core modules are as follows:
* Users
* Rank
* Pages
* Languages
* HashTable


## Core Modules

### Users ###
The User module allows administrators to create, modify and delete users.
The User module supports user rank, which can be set up permissions 
allowing each rank to do only what the administrator permits.
 
By default there are two users: Admin ( rank 10 ) and User ( rank  20 ).

### Rank ###
For now rank module only allows to see what rank they are available.

### Pages ###
Allows you to quickly create dynamic and static pages.

### Languages ###
From here you decide which languages you want to use the site.

### HashTable ###
With the HashTable module you can create different hashmap be used inside modules or the site.
