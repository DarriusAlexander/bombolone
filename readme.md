## Overview

Sometimes you simply donâ€™t need to use all the features of a CMS. 
Bombolone lets you have a good core, with five modules are essential 
for almost all web applications.

You can control them from the administration panel, and each has 
different tools to edit, create or delete.
It's important to note that beginning the application has two types 
of users: administrators and users. Administrator can do everything. 
Users can only edit content and other little things,
but configurable to allow multiple levels of access depending on rank.

The core modules are as follows:
* Users
* Rank
* Pages
* Languages
* HashTable


## Core Modules

### Users ###
Allows user administration: 
* Administrators : can create, modify or delete users.
* Users : can only read the account list by default.

### Rank ###

### Pages ###

* Administrators : can create, edit, modify or delete pages.
* Users : can edit any content pages by default.

### Languages ###
From here you can decide which languages you want the site to use.

### HashTable ###
